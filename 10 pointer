Open the .pcap file in Wireshark:

Launch Wireshark and open the given .pcap capture file containing FTP traffic.

Filter FTP traffic:

In the Wireshark filter bar, type:

kotlin
Copy
Edit
ftp || ftp-data
This filters FTP commands and data packets.

Identify the file transfer:

Look for FTP commands like RETR which indicate file retrieval.

In the command packets, you can often see the file name being requested or transferred.

Follow the FTP data stream:

Right-click on a relevant FTP data packet → Follow → TCP Stream or Follow → FTP Data Stream (depending on Wireshark version).

This allows you to see the raw transferred file content.

Export the file:

Go to File → Export Objects → FTP...

Wireshark will show a list of files transferred via FTP in this capture.

Select the file(s) and save them to your disk.

Identify the file type:

The file name and extension will be visible in the export window.

Alternatively, after saving, check the file properties or open it with an appropriate program to verify the type.
