Task:
On a Windows machine, find out which services are listening for HTTP traffic (port 80). Run the command:

bash
Copy
Edit
netstat -ano | find ":80"
Then, use tasklist to identify the processes using those ports. Provide 2 ports and their corresponding process names.

Step-by-step instructions:
Open Command Prompt as Administrator:

Press Win + R, type cmd, and press Ctrl + Shift + Enter to open with admin rights.

Run netstat command to find ports listening on port 80:

bash
Copy
Edit
netstat -ano | find ":80"
This lists all connections and listening ports involving port 80.

The output includes the local address, state, and PID (Process ID).

Note down the PIDs from the output:

Identify the Process IDs (PIDs) corresponding to entries with port 80.

Find the process names for those PIDs:

bash
Copy
Edit
tasklist /FI "PID eq <PID>"
Replace <PID> with the actual Process ID number.

This will show the process name running on that PID.

Repeat step 4 for at least 2 different PIDs using port 80.

Prepare your answer listing:

Port 80 - Process Name (e.g., 80 - svchost.exe)

Another port with 80 in the connection - Process Name
