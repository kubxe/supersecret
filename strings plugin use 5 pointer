Use the strings tool to analyze a given .exe file and search for keywords that may indicate network connections or login-related data (such as "login", "api", "token"). Then, select at least two relevant values and save them in a .txt file.
Step-by-Step:
1. Open Terminal (Linux) or Command Prompt (Windows with Sysinternals or Ghidra tools).
2. Run strings on the .exe file:
On Linux:

strings suspicious.exe > all_strings.txt
On Windows (with Sysinternals or Ghidra installed):
cmd
strings suspicious.exe > all_strings.txt
3. Search for relevant keywords:
You can open all_strings.txt in a text editor and look for:

login

password

token

api

http, https

IP addresses or domain names

Or use grep (Linux/macOS) to search automatically:


grep -iE "login|api|token|auth|http" all_strings.txt
4. Select at least two meaningful values from the results. For example:
https://api.example.com/v1/login

Authorization: Bearer 9fj29fj209fj20fj2

5. Save them to a separate text file:
bash
Copy
Edit
echo "https://api.example.com/v1/login" > findings.txt
echo "token=ABCD1234XYZ" >> findings.txt
Or manually paste into findings.txt using a text editor.

📝 Example Output (findings.txt):

https://api.hackserver.com/v1/auth
token=abc123def456
