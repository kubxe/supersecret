1. Check if the DLL is packed (e.g., with UPX):
Use the command:

bash
Copy
Edit
upx -t suspicious.dll
or

bash
Copy
Edit
die suspicious.dll
(using Detect It Easy (DIE) GUI tool)

If it‚Äôs packed with UPX, it will say:
"Packed with UPX"

2. Unpack the DLL (if packed):
If it‚Äôs UPX packed, run:

bash
Copy
Edit
upx -d suspicious.dll
For other packers, use tools like:

PEiD

Exeinfo PE

Unpack manually in a sandbox or debugger (e.g., x64dbg)

3. Extract and analyze strings:
Run:

bash
Copy
Edit
strings suspicious.dll > output.txt
Search for suspicious keywords in the output such as:

socket

keylogger

powershell

cmd.exe

URLs or IP addresses

Encryption-related terms (e.g., AES, RC4)

4. Check DLL Imports and API Calls:
Use PEStudio or Dependency Walker:

In PEStudio:

Look under "Imports" or "Indicators"

Look for suspicious APIs:

CreateRemoteThread

VirtualAlloc

WriteProcessMemory

WinExec, ShellExecute, InternetOpen, etc.

In Dependency Walker:

Open the .dll file and examine the DLLs and APIs it imports.

5. Scan on VirusTotal:
Go to https://www.virustotal.com/

Upload the .dll file

Review the detection names, AV engines, and behaviors flagged.

6. Determine the threat type:
Based on:

Strings (e.g., presence of keylogger, ransom, etc.)

API usage (e.g., injecting code, creating sockets, file encryption)

VirusTotal results (label names like Trojan, Ransomware, Spyware)

You can classify the file as one of the following (if applicable):

Spyware

Keylogger

RAT (Remote Access Trojan)

Ransomware

Dropper (delivers other malware)

Backdoor

üìù Example Summary Answer:
Packed: Yes, packed with UPX

Unpacked successfully: Yes

Suspicious Strings Found: powershell, socket, cmd.exe

API Calls: CreateRemoteThread, VirtualAlloc, LoadLibrary

VirusTotal Detections: 35/70 ‚Äì Detected as Trojan.RAT, Backdoor.Generic

Threat Type: Remote Access Trojan (RAT)
