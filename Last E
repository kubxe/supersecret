Here’s a detailed English explanation and commands for Ticket E tasks:

⸻

1. Find the most recent logged-in user on Kali Linux (Easy, 5 points)

Command:

last -n 1 | head -n 1 | awk '{print $1}'

Explanation:
The last command shows recent logins. The above extracts the username of the latest login session.

⸻

2. Identify processes listening on ports 22 (SSH) and 80 (HTTP) and their PIDs (Easy, 5 points)

Command:

sudo netstat -tulpn | grep -E ':(22|80) '

Or using ss:

sudo ss -tulpn | grep -E ':(22|80)'

Explanation:
Lists open TCP ports with associated process names and PIDs. The filter shows only lines for ports 22 and 80.

⸻

3. Create new user “student1” and set password (Easy, 5 points)

Commands:

sudo adduser student1

	•	When prompted for full name and other info, press Enter to skip.

Then set the password:

sudo passwd student1

	•	Enter the password twice as prompted.

Expected output: Confirmation messages about user creation and password update.

⸻

4. Capture SYN packets during an nmap TCP SYN scan with tcpdump (Medium, 10 points)

On target Kali Linux VM:

sudo tcpdump -i <interface> 'tcp[tcpflags] & tcp-syn != 0 and tcp[tcpflags] & tcp-ack == 0'

	•	Replace <interface> with your network interface, e.g., eth0 or ens33.

On attacker VM: Run nmap SYN scan against the target:

nmap -sS <target_ip>

Explanation:
Tcpdump command filters SYN packets without ACK flags, capturing the scan packets.

⸻

5. Scan Metasploitable2 for vulnerabilities on port 445 using nmap (Medium, 10 points)

Command:

nmap -p 445 --script vuln <Metasploitable2_IP>

Look for: CVE code and vulnerability title in the output, for example:
	•	CVE-2009-3103 (Microsoft Windows SMB vulnerability)
	•	Or other identified CVEs.

⸻

6. Find users logged in during last 24 hours with last and grep (Medium, 10 points)

Command:

last | grep "$(date +%b\ %d)" | awk '{print $1, $4, $5, $6, $7}' | uniq | head -n 2

Explanation:
Filters last login entries for today’s date, extracts usernames and login times, shows two distinct users.

⸻

7. Vulnerability scan comparison on Metasploitable2 with nmap and Nessus (Hard, 20 points)

Steps:
	•	Run nmap scan:

nmap -A --script vuln <Metasploitable2_IP>

	•	Note detected vulnerabilities, CVE codes, and descriptions.
	•	Run Nessus scan with “Advanced Scan” profile on same target.

Compare:
	•	Identify a common vulnerability detected by both tools (e.g., vsftpd backdoor or Samba vulnerabilities).
	•	Write CVE number and brief explanation.
	•	Explain how nmap presents the info (usually as script output with brief info), and Nessus (detailed report with risk ratings, remediation advice).
	•	Discuss extra security recommendations Nessus might provide (patching, disabling vulnerable services, applying updates).
