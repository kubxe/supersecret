Task:
Using Process Explorer and TCPView, investigate running processes on the system to identify:

Processes performing file system access and registry write operations.

Processes establishing network connections.

If such processes are found, collect information on:

The DLL files they have loaded.

The IP addresses they are communicating with.

Summarize your findings briefly.

Step-by-step guide:
Open Process Explorer:

Sort or filter processes by their file system and registry activity.

Look for processes with active handles to files or registry keys indicating write operations.

Right-click a suspicious process and check its Properties â†’ DLLs tab to list loaded DLLs.

Open TCPView:

Observe all network connections established by processes.

Identify which processes have active TCP/UDP connections.

Note the remote IP addresses and ports they are connected to.

Cross-reference findings:

Identify processes that do both: file/registry activity and network communication.

Summarize:

Example:
Process malware.exe

Loaded DLLs: ws2_32.dll, kernel32.dll, user32.dll

Connected IPs: 203.0.113.10:443, 198.51.100.22:80

Activity: Writes to HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run (auto-start registry key) and modifies files in %APPDATA%.
