Open a terminal in your Linux system.

Run the Nmap service/version scan:

nmap -sV 192.168.56.101
-sV enables version detection, which helps identify which service (and version) is running on each open port.

Wait for the scan to complete.

From the output, choose 3 services and their ports.
For example:

pgsql
PORT     STATE SERVICE     VERSION
22/tcp   open  ssh         OpenSSH 7.9
80/tcp   open  http        Apache httpd 2.4.29
3306/tcp open  mysql       MySQL 5.7.25
Take a screenshot of the terminal output showing these results.
