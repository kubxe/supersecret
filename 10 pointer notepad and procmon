Using Sysinternals Process Monitor (Procmon.exe), monitor the file system changes made by the notepad.exe process. Set a filter in Procmon to record only file operations performed by notepad.exe. Identify at least 2 files and describe the changes made to them.

Step-by-step instructions:
Run Process Monitor as Administrator:

Download and launch Procmon.exe from the Sysinternals Suite.

Run it with administrative privileges.

Set a filter for notepad.exe:

Click on Filter → Filter... or press Ctrl + L.

Add a filter rule:

Process Name → is → notepad.exe → Include

Click Add, then OK.

Filter only file system operations:

To focus on file operations, you can further filter by Operation → begins with → WriteFile, CreateFile, DeleteFile, or simply observe file system-related operations.

Or, after capturing, you can sort and filter by Operation column showing file operations.

Start monitoring and perform some actions in Notepad:

Open Notepad and open or create some files, then save or modify them.

Stop capturing in Procmon after the actions are done:

Click the capture icon or press Ctrl + E to stop.

Analyze the captured events:

Look for file operations related to at least two different files.

Note the file path, operation type (e.g., WriteFile, CreateFile), and the effect of the change (e.g., file creation, modification).

Example answer format:
File 1: C:\Users\User\Documents\example.txt
Change: File was opened and modified (WriteFile operation).

File 2: C:\Users\User\AppData\Local\Temp\~tmpfile.txt
Change: Temporary file created and written during Notepad session.
